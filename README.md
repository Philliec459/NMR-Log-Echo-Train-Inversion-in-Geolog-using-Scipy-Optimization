# NMR-Log-Echo-Train-Inversion-in-Geolog-using-Scipy-Optimization
This repository uses NMR log echo train inversion using Scipy optimization using Tikhonov regularization, which adds a penalty term equal to the sum of the squares of the parameters. 

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook as well as a Geolog project with a Geolog python loglan with full code.
